## Getting Started
1. **Requirements:**
    * PHP 8.0 or higher
    * Composer
    * MySQL (or other supported database)
    * Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

2. **Steps:**
    * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/akassama/igniter-cms` (Replace with your actual repo URL)
    * Navigate to the project folder: `cd igniter-cms`
    * Install dependencies: `composer install`
    * **Configure Database Connection:**
        * The database configuration is managed via a `.env` file. If you don't have one, create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
        * Add the following database configuration settings to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual database credentials:
        ```
        database.default.hostname = localhost
        database.default.database = igniter_db
        database.default.username = root
        database.default.password = 
        database.default.DBDriver = MySQLi
        database.default.DBPrefix = 
        database.default.port = 3306
        ```
        * Alternatively, you can directly edit the database configuration in `app/Config/Database.php`:
        ```
        public array $default = [
            'DSN'     => '',
            'hostname' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_hostname' : 'localhost',
            'username' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_db_username' : 'root',
            'password' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_db_password' : '',
            'database' => ENVIRONMENT === 'production' ? 'prod_db' : 'igniter_db',
            'DBDriver' => 'MySQLi',
            // other settings
        ];
        ```
        Make sure to update the `hostname`, `username`, `password`, and `database` fields with your database connection details.
    * Create the Database: Using your database management system (e.g., PhpMyAdmin), create a new database with the same name specified in `Database.php`.
    * Set Up Base URL: Edit the configuration file located in `app/Config/App.php`
    * Make sure to have the environment variable `CI_ENVIRONMENT = development` in the .env file. 
    * Run migrations: `php spark migrate`. This command will execute all available migrations, creating the necessary database tables.
    * Start the Application
      Ensure that your local server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is running, then navigate to the base URL you set earlier:
    ```
    https://localhost/igniter-cms
    ```
    * Default Admin Login

        You can log in using the default Admin credentials:
        * Email: admin@example.com
        * Password: Admin@1
      
        To modify the default Admin login, go to the migration file located at `app/Database/Migrations/2024-08-27-210112_Users.php` and update the `$data[]` array accordingly.
3. **Permissions:** Ensure `writable` and `public/uploads` directories are writable by the web server.

4. **Email Configuration:** To enable email functionality, you need to configure your Mailjet settings in `/account/admin/configurations` page:
    ```
    MailjetApiKey = 'your-mailjet-api-key';
    MailjetApiSecret = 'your-mailjet-api-secret';
    ```

## How to Customize System Features?
### Customizing Notification Messages
To customize system messages:
* Edit `app/Config/CustomConfig.php` to modify existing messages or add new ones.

### Customizing Activity Logging
To update activity log types:
* See  `app/Constants/ActivityTypes.php`
* Update the value or add new constants, for example
```
const PUSH_NOTIFICATION = 'push_notification';
```

* Add the description in the function
```
public static function getDescription($type)
{
    $descriptions = [
        self::PUSH_NOTIFICATION => 'Push Notification Sent',
        // Add more descriptions as needed
    ];

    return $descriptions[$type] ?? 'Unknown Activity';
}
```

## Usage Examples in Controllers
To see how configurations are used, review the code in AdminController or other controllers located in the `app/Controllers` directory.

### Helper Functions
